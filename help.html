			<h1>Agariomods Features</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Ogar Servers
					<ul>
						<li>In light of the disablement of connecting to servers by ip, we decided to create private servers with an open source program called Ogar.</li>
						<li>While spectating, you can change the spectated player with the Q key.</li>
						<li>
							Game Modes
							<ul>
								<li>
									Free For All
									<ul>
										<li>In free for all your sole goal is to be the largest cell.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									Teams
									<ul>
										<li>In teams there are 3 factiongs, green, blue, and red. Your goal is to make the combined mass of your teams cells greater than any other.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									Hunger Games
									<ul>
										<li>This game mode is just like FFA, but you only get one life.</li>
										<li>In the center of the map there is free mass, surrounded by viruses.</li>
										<li>
											To join a match you must press the play button once a match ends, other people are also trying to join so you must be quick.
											<ul>
												<li>If you press it too early or too late, you will see a blank screen, to get out of it you need to press ESC and click 'Spectate'.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									Hide and Seek
									<ul>
										<li>Seekers are red, Hiders are blue.</li>
										<li>When the game starts, a random player is chosen as a seeker, who is then teleported to the middle of the game, and blinded.</li>
										<li>Hiders hide in viruses, or stay on the run, avoiding getting tagged by seekers.</li>
										<li>When a seeker tags a hider, the hider becomes a seeker.</li>
										<li>When there are no more hiders, the seekers will win.</li>
										<li>If there are still hiders left when time runs out, the hiders will win.</li>
										<li>When there is only one hider remaining, the direction the hider is from a seeker will be shown every 10 seconds.</li>
										<li>A virus is translucent to a player that is under it.</li>
										<li>Hold Q to sprint.</li>
										<li><ul>
											<li>You have stamina, it's not unlimited.</li>												
										</ul></li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Chat
							<ul>
								<li>We have chat servers setup on our ogar servers.</li>

								<li>To enable chat, you must authenticate your account with your Agariomods installation from your profile page at <a href='http://connect.agariomods.com/'>connect.agariomods.com</a>.</li>

									skin to their account, the cell's will have that user's
									skin.
