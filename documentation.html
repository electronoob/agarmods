    <ol>
    		<li>Ogar Servers
    				<ul>
    						<li>In light of the disablement of connecting to servers by ip, we decided to create private servers with an open source program called Ogar.
    						</li>
    						<li>While spectating, you can change the spectated player with e Q key.
    						</li>
    						<li>Game Modes

	    						</ul>
	    						</li>
	    						<li>Hunger Games
	    						<ul>
	    						 <li>This game mode is just like FFA, but you only get one life. 
	    						 </li>
	    						 <li>In the center of the map there is free mass, surrounded by viruses.
	    						 </li>
	    						 <li>To join a match you must press the play button once a match ends, other people are also trying to join so you must be quick.
	    						 <ul>
	    						 <li>If you press it too early or too late, you will see a blank screen, to get out of it you need to press ESC and click 'Spectate'.

    					<li>Chat
    					<ul>
    						<li>We have chat servers setup on our ogar servers.
    						</li>
    						<li>This feature requires an account at <a href=                         'http://connect.agariomods.com/'>connect.agariomods.com</a>
    						</li>

    		</li>
        <li>Current Mass
            <ul>
                <li>The 'Score' counter in the vanilla game only showed your
                high score. That has been replaced with a counter of how much
                mass you currently have, with the 'Score' counter renamed to
                'High Score' to the right.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Additional Skins
            <ul>
                <li>This adds additional skins to the game that can be used by
                using a certain name for your cell.</li>
                <li>These skins are not visible to those who don't use this
                mod.</li>
                <li>The list of additional skins can be found at
                http://skins.agariomods.com/</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Custom Skins
            <ul>
                <li>Custom Skins will only be seen by other Agariomods
                users</li>
                <li>You can turn custom skins on and off with the "No Custom
                Skins" setting.</li>
                <li>There is <b>no</b> filtering of Custom images. If you are
                in an environment where NSFW images can cause issue, it is
                recommended to disable this feature.</li>

                        <li>If the user exists, and that user has uploaded a
                        skin to their account, the cell's will have that user's
